Sitara ARM Proceessors Boot Camp


To help explore infinite design possibilities with TI Sitara™ ARM® 
Processors, Texas Instruments has created the Sitara ARM Processors 
Boot Camp. This modular training series for TI’s Sitara ARM Processors 
is based on the latest development kits from TI and provides in-depth 
technical discussion and hands-on exercises for all aspects of 
the solution; from architecture to peripherals to software and 
development environments. Each module in the Sitara ARM Processors 
Boot Camp reviews the features, mechanics, and resources of their 
respective topics, making it easy to focus on the training topics 
most relevant to your current design challenge.
